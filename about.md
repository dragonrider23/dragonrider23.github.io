Onesimus Systems began in Fall 2013 with Dandelion ([source](https://github.com/onesimus-systems/dandelion)). Since then many more projects have been created all with the intent of either solving a problem, or learning new techniques.
In the main GitHub repo [github.com/lfkeitel](https://github.com/lfkeitel) you will find several projects, some complete some not so much. But nonetheless, each has a purpose.
Most applications are written in PHP or Go, more of the latter these days. All are released as open-source software. Use them, learn from them, help me improve them.

You can find the source code for this site at: [github.com/lfkeitel/lfkeitel.github.io](https://github.com/lfkeitel/lfkeitel.github.io)
