Nitrogen is a Lisp-based programming language I created to learn fundamentally how programming languages work. It is not designed to be used in any sort of production environment. It's very minimal, but usable. It's based off the book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/).

On this page you will be able to find the docmentation for the builtin functions as well as the Standard Library. You'll also find some examples to play with.

You can find the source code for the Nitrogen interpreter at: [github.com/dragonrider23/dragonrider23.github.io](https://github.com/dragonrider23/dragonrider23.github.io)
